INPUT:
"Person with soft face shape, light skin, simple expressive eyes, long dark hair, blue jacket, cheerful pose with hand near cheek."

OUTPUT:
"A stylized chibi character inspired by the Animal Crossing aesthetic, based on the provided description. The soft face shape becomes a rounded simplified form, light skin rendered with matte pastel tones, and expressive eyes enlarged into signature round stylized shapes. Long dark hair becomes smooth chunky sections retaining the original length and flow. The blue jacket is simplified into clean geometric shapes. The cheerful pose with the hand near the cheek is preserved exactly. Chibi proportions follow a large head and small compact body with rounded limbs. Surfaces appear soft and toy‑like with uniform lighting, pastel coloring, and smooth contours. The final character keeps the recognizable silhouette, pose, and color scheme while expressing a friendly, playful mood."

Colors remain bright and pastel, keeping the friendly and approachable style consistent."
