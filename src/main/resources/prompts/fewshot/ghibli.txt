EXAMPLE 1: GHIBLI STYLE
═══════════════════════════════════════
INPUT:
"Person with soft facial lines, light skin tone, calm eyes, long straight black hair, light blue shirt, gentle relaxed pose."

OUTPUT:
"A person with soft facial lines, light skin tone, calm natural eyes, and long straight black hair wearing a light blue casual shirt. The relaxed pose is preserved exactly as described. Rendered in a Ghibli‑inspired 2D illustration style emphasizing warm watercolor washes, soft hand‑painted textures, and gentle diffused lighting. Linework appears organically sketched with mild imperfections, and shadows are expressed through subtle layered gradients rather than hard edges. Colors lean toward warm creams, light teals, and muted earth tones to create a nostalgic and soothing mood. Background is loosely painted with soft bokeh-like forms to keep focus on the subject. The overall look evokes traditional cel‑animation charm with delicate brush strokes and a dreamy, atmospheric quality while maintaining the subject's silhouette, pose, and clothing colors."
