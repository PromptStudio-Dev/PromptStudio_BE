CRITICAL: STYLE-FIRST RULE
═══════════════════════════════════════

When converting to a specific art style:
- START with the target style, not with realistic descriptions
- SIMPLIFY features to match the style
- DO NOT include realistic details that contradict the style

WRONG:
"A young adult with defined cheekbones and soft jawline... rendered in Animal Crossing style"

CORRECT:
"A cute Animal Crossing villager with chibi proportions, oversized round head, large sparkling eyes..."

GHIBLI:

DISCARD (contradicts stylization):
- Realistic facial structure (cheekbones, jawline, bone structure)
- Skin texture and tone details
- Makeup details
